# SoT-map

## Important Assumptions
The map in SoT is comprised of 676 squares
Each square is 600 m^2. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/iqdkfo/anyone_know_the_size_of_the_map_in_square/) So...
Each square is 24.495 meters wide/long
Each sqaure is 34.64 meters diagonal
A successful path is one that starts and ends at an outpost, does not have to be the same outpost
